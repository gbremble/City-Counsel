# City Counsel

City Counsel is a web application that provides a user with helpful information on a given city.
* relevant photo
* description
* weather forecast
* popular restaurants
* upcoming events

## Motivation
City Counsel is the collaborative effort representing group project 1 from group 3, and ties in learnings to date (as well as exploration of new tech).  Production timeline was two weeks.

The application complies with the guidelines provided to the team.  Namely:
* It utilizes AJAX to pull data
* Utilizes at least one new library or technology not yet covered / discussed
* It has a polished UI, and does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts.
* It makes use of a repeating element (table)
* Uses Bootstrap for responsiveness
* Has user input validation
* Is deployed (GitHub pages / Firebase)

## Project Usefulness
This webapp is useful as a tool for aggregating information from multiple sources into one location, which saves the user from searching through multiple browser tabs that are focused on gathering a specific type of information, as well as keeping track / organizing that info once it's gathered.  City Counsel provides the user with multiple relevant pieces of information in one easily scrollable location.

## Getting Started
Upon loading, City Counsel presents the user with a dropdown box of available cities to search, a button for executing the search, and a view of recent searches as a way of indicating what is trending.

1.  The user selects their city from the city dropdown input box.
2.  Once they have their city, they click the search button to the right.
3.  Scroll down to review a relevant image and read a short description of the chosen city.
4.  Review the city's current weather and upcoming forecast.
5.  Learn about popular restaurants, and click on the provided links to view more information.
6.  View the upcoming events listing to learn about interesting upcoming events.
